            <h1>Mobile Browsing - Analysis </h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Spending an entire day doing my browsing on only my phones
                internet browser (I use the chrome app usually) was pretty
                interesting! I guess I had never taken notice that there's
                so many websites out there that don't really target mobile
                users all that well. Anyways, here are my findings
            </p>
            <h2>Questions to consider:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Can you still see what you want to see?</li>
                <li>Can you find what you're looking for?</li>
                <li>Can you do what you want to do?</li>
                <li>Any frustrations?</li>
                <li>Anything work better on the small screen?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <h3>Can you still see what you want to see?</h3>
            <p>
                <p>
                    <b>Answer: yes</b>
                </p>
                I use google a ton, honestly who doesn't these days? what I found most
                Interesting was how similar it was on my mobile browser. I didn't
                have any issues with visibility, the images were still clear, and the
                results I found for all my searches were easy to read. It was actually
                a little nice to have the mobile browser as most of the content was
                concise and clear.
            </p>
            <h3>Can you find what you're looking for?</h3>
            <p>
            <p>
                <b>Answer: sometimes...</b>
            </p>
                Browsing Youtube's website would automatically load up their mobile
                version of the website. m.youtube.com, which is basically their mobile
                application anyway. These is a bit of a scape-goat on Youtube's part,
                but pretty smart. I found the navigation a little more tedious but
                not that difficult to master within a few minutes. </br>
                Other sites I visited were similar in the sense that they were pretty
                mobile friendly. Most big companies out there (facebook, graigslist,
                and pcpartpicker, etc.) were very mobile friendly. but more small end
                companies (teton vu was one I came across) were still somewhat mobile
                friendly but still had minor scrolling issues that moved the screen
                out of place. </br>
                Surprisingly however, after logging into byui.edu, the website is
                pretty bad, from a mobile perspective.
            </p>
            <h3>Can you do what you want to do?</h3>
            <p>
            <p>
                <b>Answer: yes, if it's not with byui.edu...</b>
            </p>
                For the most part I was able to do everything I needed. Trying Byui.edu
                however was a bust.
            </p>
            <h3>Any frustrations?</h3>
            <p>
            <p>
                <b>Answer: No, as long as it's not byui.edu...</b>
            </p>
                I was pretty satisfied with my browsing experiences. There wasn't really
                anything (byui.edu excepted) that was too frustrating.
            </p>
            <h3>Anything work better on the small screen?</h3>
            <p>
            <p>
                <b>Answer: actually yes</b>
            </p>
                I was surprised by how easy it was to find what I wanted on the mobile
                sites. It was mentioned in class, but mobile forces people to consolidate.
                This is a very handy side effect in my opinion.
            </p>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                Mobile browsing wasn't that bad. In today's world I'm not surprised though.
                Most people are using their phones more than their computers, my brother in
                law being one of them. I asked him why he never really used his laptop except
                for homework and his answer says it all "it's easier." And this experience leads
                me to take his side a bit more.

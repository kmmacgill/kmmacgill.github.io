        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            The client would like a web based weather app created.
            The purpose of the site is to give current weather
            conditions in 3 different ways.  The initial landing
            page will give the weather for the current location
            based on the Geocoding information given by the browser.
            The second is weather for 3 specific locations accessible
            through a dedicated link, and the third is weather for any
            location determined by a search string.
        </p>

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>
            Primary audience is adults ages 18-30.
            Most will be students.  Access to the site
            will be split between mobile devices and laptops.
        </p>
        <h5>Audience Goals:</h5>
        <p>
            College students move around quite a bit so one
            goal would be to quickly get the weather conditions
            for their current location as they head off to class
            or study. They are also often far from their homes so
            the ability to quickly get the conditions for a specific
            location is important as well.  The third goal deals
            with planning for travels...the ability to get weather
            conditions for any location will help with last minute
            packing for road trips.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Name:</b>Joe Cool</li>
            <li><b>Occupation:</b>student</li>
            <li><b>Age:</b>undetermined</li>
            <li><b>Interests:</b>Traveling, seeing new things</li>
            <li><b>Motivation:</b>Joe is not into planning.  His last
                minute scrambling, whether it is getting to class in
                the morning or heading out on his latest adventure,
                has left him unprepared for weather conditions many
                times (He is tired of sleeping in the rain and snow).
                He would like to be more prepared...without having to
                put much effort into it...or planning.
            </li>
            <li><b>Envirgonment:</b>Joe is comfortable using laptops
                and Mobile devices, he will most often be found on a
                smart phone however.  Many of the places he frequents
                do not have great signal…he is often dealing with 3G
                speeds

                access to the weather conditions for many locations

                unsolicited advice to her peers.
            </li>
            <li><b>Envirgonment:</b>Lucy has a smart phone that she
                uses to keep her eye on her social media ‘friends’.
                She is usually not very far from her trusty laptop
                however. Most of her time online is spent either on
                the University network or the apartment broadband.

            <h2>Target Audience & Persona</h2>
            <p>
                The target audience of my website will be people interested in D&D. This will
                be both dungeon masters (mostly dungeon masters in fact) and also the players
                themselves.

            <ul>
                <li><b>Name:</b>Josh Forrester</li>
                <li><b>Occupation:</b>student</li>
                <li><b>Age:</b>24</li>
                <li><b>Interests:</b>Electrical Engineering, playing D&D</li>
                <li><b>Motivation:</b>Josh plays D&D weekly and has been wanting to get into hosting his own games
                    and has decided that he would, if only it were a little more simple to run a
                    game. If he could have some utility tool to help him he thinks he could accomplish
                    his goal of running fun, exciting, and memorable games.
                </li>
                <li><b>Environment:</b>Josh is very familiar using a laptop, desktop, and other electrical
                    equipment. Websites are nothing new to him. He is willing to take the extra effort to
                    familiarize himself with a tool to master it.

                </li>
                <li><b>Environment:</b>Korey uses computer's all the time. He is often found programming something

            <h2>Page Descriptions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Page 1: Party Management
                    <p>
                        This page will be the party management page.
                        This page includes a form to fill out to add
                        a new character to your characters in your party.
                        The page will have an add button, which will run
                        some javascript to add the information provided into
                        a form into a table that holds the party info.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Page 2: Monster References
                    <p>
                        This will be an alphabetical list that people can select
                        from to get reference information on the monster.
                        There will be an alphabetical list on the top of the page
                        going horizontally, clicking one, will bring up a list of
                        the monsters under that letter, and you can read about them.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Page 3: Spell References
                    <p>
                        This will be the same layout as monster reference. Horizontal
                        alphabet on the top, and clicking one, brings up the spells under
                        that letter.
                    </p>
                </li>

                    <p>
                        This will have a form you can fill out, and a button you
                        can press to fill in the remaining information. This allows for
                        fully customizable, or completely random, or a nice mixture of
                        different NPCs.

                </li>

                        This will be a simple layout of 4 buttons called "easy",
                        "normal", "difficult", and "deadly". Upon clicking one the page
                        underneath the buttons will fill in with an appropriate encounter
                        of monsters based on their challenge rating, and the current
                        party's level.
